## Summary
Mobile surround is a web app for mobile devices that takes an audio file (on a rails back-end), down-mixes it into component channels and sends them to a group of iPhones to play surround sound. Users can create new sound groups and upload new sound files on the fly, and create a surround sound environment with nothing but phones. The sound files themselves are hosted using http links and synchrony among a group is established using ActionCable.

## Features

### Feature 1: Sound groups
Users can create new sound groups and then their friends can join.

### Feature 2: Sound uploading
Users can upload sound files for later viewing.

### Feature 3: Sound downloading
When a sound group member picks a track from the menu, all users in the group are sent a message via ActionCable to download their channel.

### Feature 4: Sound playback
Users can play sound tracks and then other users in the same sound group will all hear them synchronously. Under the hood, a schedule-delay algorithm is used to maximize the synchrony of the sound onset.

### Feature 5: Mobile and laptop compatibility
The page was made with mobile-first styling. Since GPS is the most accurate source of time on mobile devices, mobile devices establish synchrony using GPS pings. If the app detects the user is on a laptop it instead uses the computer's internal clocks.

### Feature 6: Down-mixing
The sound is down-mixed into its constituent channels, allowing each user to play a different channel of the sound and creating a true surround sound experience.

## Synchrony algorithm
A key technical feature of this app is establishing synchrony of sound onset using ActionCable. Internet latency has unacceptable variability for the functionality we require. Instead, when a user sends a play sound command, a timestamp is taken and sent to the server.

```javascript
window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((time) =>
{$.ajax({url: '<%=current_user.sound_group_id%>/play', data: {time: time}})});
```

The rails server receives this message on a custom route and uses ActionCable to send the master timestamp to every member of the SoundGroup.

```ruby
@sound_group = SoundGroup.find(params[:id])
SoundGroupChannel.broadcast_to(@sound_group, scheduled_time:
params[:time] [:timestamp])
```

Finally, each of the clients, when it "receives" the ActionCable signal, appends a fixed amount of time and delays itself until the established master time before executing the playsound function.

```javascript
received: ({scheduled_time}) => {
  let soundPlayer = document.getElementById('sound-player');
  scheduled_time = parseInt(scheduled_time)+2000;
  window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((time) => {
    time=parseInt(time.timestamp);
    setTimeout(()=>{soundPlayer.play();}, scheduled_time-time);
  });
}
```

## Future plans
- We intend to remain active with developing MobileSurroud further.
  - Robust response to sound-group-show audio choices.
  - Android functionality.
  - AWS S3 hosting for upload/download.
  - ChannelSplitterNode for down-mixing.
  - React-Native/Mobile build.
  - API-Layer for other apps to use.
  - Blue tooth hand shaking.
  - Blue tooth time sync.
  - Pause/unpause buttons.
